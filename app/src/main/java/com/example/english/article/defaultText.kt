            "\n" +
            "If their bid is successful it would be the first union at one of the tech giant's US stores.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "The group of staff known as Fruit Stand Workers United must get signatures of support from 30% of colleagues at the store to qualify for a union election.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "The move follows unionisation drives by staff at Starbucks and Amazon. Apple has not commented on the announcement.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "A statement on a campaign website for the prospective union said: \"Grand Central is an extraordinary store with unique working conditions that make a union necessary to ensure our team has the best possible standards of living.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Amazon workers win battle to form first US union\n" +
            "US Starbucks store votes for labour union\n" +
            "The group described themselves as working in \"extraordinary times with the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and once-in-a-generation consumer price inflation,\" though their website did not disclose the name of staff members leading the effort.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "\n" +
            "The group said it also wants a \$30 (Â£23) minimum hourly wage for all workers, additional holiday time and information on more robust safety protocols at the Grand Central location.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "The campaign is connected to Workers United, an affiliate of the national Service Employees International Union, which was established in 2009 from several earlier unions.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "The Apple effort comes as a Starbucks unionisation drive backed by Workers United has spread nationally after election victories last year in New York.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Amazon is also facing a growing challenge from unions after an upstart campaign won an election at a warehouse in nearby Staten Island earlier this month.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Employees working in at least three other Apple stores are also attempting to organize, according to The Washington Post.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC."
